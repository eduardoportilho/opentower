# Roadmap:

## Bugs:

- ✅ Chrome complaining about frozen tab (not happening any more...)
- ✅ Deploy tower on top of another tower
    - ✅ Blocked tower cells not matching tower posistion  
- ✅ Goon movement is not smooth
    - To be smooth, goon should move on pixel intervals (instead of cells)
        - The problem is that to recalculate the path for every pixel is taking to much time, making the movement "choke".
            - Is it possible to optimize path finder to work smoothly for all pixels?
            - Is it possible to move in pixels but to use a cell path? 
        - Another problem is that if we calculate the path in pixels, the goon might pass between two towers if there is 1 px space (and the goon image needs to be bigger than 1 px)
            - Is it possible to implement pathfinder with a goon that occupy more than 1 cell? Am I overcomplicating?
- ✅ If you deploy a tower on top of a goon he disaper
- ✅ Goons going out of grid
- ✅ Goon stoping (ex. when they need to return)
- ✅ Weird movement on speed 50
- ✅ Unable to deploy tower (red highlight) on valid position
- ✅ Goon trapped exception

## Features:

- ✅ expose grid draw method
- ✅ draw grid
- ✅ grid: on cell hover -> style
- ✅ grid: on cell click -> event
- ✅ deploy tower on click
    - ✅ Store deployed towers
    - ✅ grid draw external objects
    - ✅ grid draw layers
    - ✅ avoid deploying on occupied cell
    - ✅ Draw a tower
- ✅ spawn goon (on timeout)
    - ✅ Draw a goon
    - ✅ make goon walk across arena
    - ✅ spawn goons on different positions
    - ✅ make goons walk to same target
- ✅ make goon avoid towers
    - ✅ recalculate path (on clock? on deployed tower)
- ✅ Represent tower with cells instead of image.
- ✅ Highlight tower boundaries on hover.
- ✅ Define goon speed in pixels/s (instead of pixels/step)
- ✅ Detect if the path to target would be blocked before deploying a tower and avoid the deploy if so.
- ✅ Redraw tower
- ✅ Implement pause and step to debug
- ✅ make tower shot
    - ✅ detect goons in range (on clock)
    - ✅ deduct goon life
        - ✅ Show goon life
    - ✅ kill goon on 0 life
    - ✅ reload gun
- ✅ Deploy goons in waves
- ✅ Control cash:
    - ✅ tower cost
    - ✅ goon bounty
- ✅ Control goons that reach goal
- ✅ Config file to tweak game parameters (waves, etc)
- ✅ Create message board
- ✅ Fininsh the game in the end of the waves
- ✅ Animate shot
- ✅ Explore path finding variations
    - ✅ Diagonal move with 1,5 cost (BFS -> Dijkstra: http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
- 🚶Try to convert to isometric
    - ✅ Draw iso grid
    - 🚶Draw tile image
        - 🆕 Fix origin
        - 🆕 Mantain aspect ration
